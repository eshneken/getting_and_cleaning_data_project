# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
# Ed Shnekendorf, 2/18/2015

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to read multiple data files from a wearable computing dataset, combine them into a tidy dataset, and then output
another tidy dataset that provides a summary view of the original data.

## Contents
If you are reading this, you have most likely downloaded this repository from GitHub.  The contents of this package are as follows:

1. README.md - this file
2. CodeBook.md - A description of the layout of the output dataset
3. run_analysis.R - The R source code used to read and process the dataset
4. summary_data.txt - The summary, tidy dataset generated by this project
5. UCI HAR Dataset - The unzipped dataset used as an input for this project (retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Prerequisites
The reshape2 package must be installed.  This can be installed in your environment by running "install.package("reshape2")".

## Running the Transformation
To run this project, do the following:

1. Open run_analysis.R in an R environment (like R Studio)
2. Modify the setwd() command on line 5 to point to the root directory on your environment
3. Save run_analysis.R and run it
4. An updated version of summary_data.txt will be generated in the same directory as the run_analysis.R file
5. You can read the file and view it by using R's read.table command (e.g. summaryData <- read.table("summary_data.txt", header=TRUE)) and view it using the View command (e.g. View(summaryData))

## How the transformation works

The following are the steps taken in run_analysis.R to perform the transformation:

1. The working directory is set to the root directory that contains the UCI dataset
2. Common data that cuts across both the training and testing partitions of the dataset is read in (activity labels and feature labels)
3. The three files that make up the testing dataset are read in and merged (activity codes, subject codes, and feature data).  Subsequent to this, the activity codes are replaced with human readable activity labels and a column specifying that this is a 'Test' dataset are addeded in.
4. A similar process as in the previous step is followed for the training segment
5. The training and testing data frames, which should now be structurally equivalent, are merged together
6. All measurements which are not representations of a standard deviation or a mean are removed from the dataset
7. The dataset is reshaped to be grouped by subject identifier (subjectCode) and activity description (activityDesc) and the mean of each measurement across these groupings are returned

## Output format
A description of the output format can be found in CodeBook.md
